# FinalYearProject

Small-scale atmospheric waves are a critically-important part of the climate system, and a major uncertainty in our models of how the climate will change in coming decades. In this project, you will apply machine learning tools to novel satellite observations of these waves and data from a world-leading weather model to help better understand the relationship between weather (e.g. rainfall, wind patterns, surface temperature) and how these waves control the atmospheric flow, building up from simple regressions to much more sophisticated predictions. This work will help contribute to scientific understanding of the atmosphere and the development of next-generation weather and climate models.
